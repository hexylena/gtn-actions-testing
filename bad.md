44:The data we use in this tutorial is available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5589610).

There are several biological domains where machine learning techniques are applied for knowledge extraction from data. The following figure (retrieved from [Pedro Larra√±aga et.al, Briefings in Bioinformatics 7:1, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbk007)) shows a scheme of the main biological problems where computational methods are being applied.
